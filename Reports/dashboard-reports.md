## Dashboard

**Reporting > Reports**

The Reports Dashboard displays the list of all existing Reports. 

You can apply filters to narrow the list, create a new Report, or perform Actions on existing Reports. 

If you have more Reports than can be displayed on one page, use the navigation menu below the Reports List to view different pages.
