## Report View

**Reporting > Reports**

The Reports View displays the list of all existing Reports available to the current User. 

You can Search for a specific Report Name or apply filters (select Show advanced filters) to further narrow the list displayed. You can create a new Report, or perform Actions on existing Reports. 

If you have more Reports than can be displayed on one page, use the navigation menu below the Reports List to view different pages.
