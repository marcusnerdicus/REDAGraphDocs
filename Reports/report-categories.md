## Report Categories

Report Categories provide a reference for what data may be included in a Report Type and the associated Report's output. The Report Category also determines what Report Criteria will be available for data filtering. For example, most Report Types falling under the All Areas Category do not provide Area level filtering in Report Criteria.

Report Categories include:

- All Areas: The report data will use all MLS Areas in a Tenant's data set in the report output
- Dashboard: The report will be based on a corresponding Dashboard widget
- Neighborhood: The report will use the selected MLS Area or MLS Areas in the report output
