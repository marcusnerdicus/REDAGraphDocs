## Reports

Reports in the Web Application are primarily created by an individual user and are available only to the User logged in. A Report consists of a Report Category, a Report Type, and a Report Criteria, when needed.

Report Categories are used for organizational purposes and provide some indication of the data included in a Report Type. A Report Category must have one of the following designations: **All Areas**, **Neighborhood**, or **Dashboard**.

Report Types determine what Report Criteria a Report will use in the output when the Report is rendered.

Reports are managed by the User in the Report View.
