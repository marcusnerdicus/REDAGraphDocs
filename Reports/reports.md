## Reports

Reports in Web Application are primarily created by the individual user. A Report is made up of a Report Category, a Report Type and a Report Criteria, where needed. Report Types focus on the different ways the MLS data is organized by the Report Category. The Report Category organizes data by All Areas, Neighborhood, and Dashboard.
