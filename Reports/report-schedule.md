## Report Schedule

The Report Schedule feature allows a user to select one or more Reports previously created in the Web Application or Moblie App and have those reports emailed to  the user's email address at a scheduled time. The selected Reports are rendered using the Report's current Report Criteria. The rendered Reports are attached to an email as a PDF, along with a link to download the Reports.

A User can Create, Edit, or Delete a Report Schedule. Each row in the Report Schedules View allows two Actions: Edit and Delete. Those Actions affect only the Report Schedule selected. Report Schedules are specific to a User and will not be available to any other User.

The **Name** field is a required value supplied by the User. Select a Report Schedule Name that indicates what data will be included in the scheduled output.

The **Reports** displays a list of Reports created by the User and available for a Report Schedule.

The **Is Active** check box indicates the status of the Report Schedule.

The **Start Date** also includes a Time value which determines the time of day the Report output will be rendered and emailed to the User's registered email address.

In the example below, the User has indicated that the two Reports selected will be emailed every Monday at 8:00 AM.
