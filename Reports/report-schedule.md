## Report Schedule

The Report Schedule feature allows a user to select a Report or Reports previously created in the Web Application or Moblie App and have those reports emailed to the the user's email address at a scheduled interval. The selected Reports are rendered using the Reports current Report Criteria. The rendered Reports are attached to an email as a PDF or PDFs along with a link to download the Reports.

A User can Create, Edit, or Delete a Report Schedule. Each row in the Report Schedules View allows two Actions: Edit and Delete and those Actions effect only the Report Schedule selected. Report Schedules are specific to a User and not available to any other User.
