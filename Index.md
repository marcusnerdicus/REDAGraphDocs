# REDAGraph Documentation

The REDAGraph SaaS web and mobile applications provide a Realtor a powerful and easy to use MLS Real Estate Data Analytics reporting tool. Using daily MLS updates a Realtor can access a set of industry standard graphical and tabular reports for specific MLS Areas and email or text the report output. Most MLS reporting applications look at data from the zip code level but REDAGraph aggregates data at the MLS Area level to give a focused set of data points to help a Realtor improve pricing strategies for Sellers and Buyers.
