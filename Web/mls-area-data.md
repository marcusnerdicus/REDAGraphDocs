## MLS Area Data

The data used in all Reports and Graphs is derived from the client's MLS Data imported for User's company (Tenant). A Tenant's MLS Data is updated at least once a day but may be updated more frequently in some markets. MLS Data imported is evaluated during the import using a set of validation rules. Any MLS Data record not meeting the import validation rules is placed in a "Questionable" status and can be edited by an Administrator. Once an edit is made to a Questionable Sale (import record), the edit is applied in each subsequent data import except for the Days on Market, which is updated from the MLS data for the edited record's Listing ID.

The MLS Areas, or Neighborhood boundaries, for a Tenant are defined based on the data provided by the Tenant's MLS provider. The specific Area values are created before the first data import for a Tenant and are then maintained using the Area View available to the Administrator Role.
