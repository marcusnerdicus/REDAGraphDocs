The application Dashboard is a collection of Graphs or Reports specific to the current Tenant's MLS Data.

In the web application, Dashboard tabs that do not fit on the screen are hidden but can be accessed using the ellipse in the tab bar. 

Your screen resolution determines whether some reports will be hidden. 

The active tab determines which reports are displayed, which can be downloaded, and which are hidden. 

The order of the report tabs is determined by the active tab and will change depending on which tab is active.
