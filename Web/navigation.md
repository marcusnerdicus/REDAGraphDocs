# Navigation

Navigating the REDAGraph web application is key to maximizing the application's features. 

The quickest way to go from section to section within REDAGraph is to use the side navigation bar and select the application feature you want to use.
Some menu options will not be available, depending on the User Role assigned. The Administrator Role will have more menu options than the Agent Role.

Note: the menu can be collapsed and expanded to the side using the two arrows highlighted.
