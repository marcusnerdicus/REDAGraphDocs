# Quick Start Guide

> This document explains how you will log in to REDAGraph for the first time. You will need the user email and initial password you received (via email) before you begin. If you do not have your application login credentials, please contact your company or association representative.

1.  Navigate to https://my-agency-id.redagraph.com (the **my-agency-id** value is specific to your organization).
2.  The initial login view verifies that the user's email address is associated with a valid account. Using the email, enter the email address and click "Check email".
3.  If a valid account is located, the user will be redirected to the Tenant Login View.
4.  Using the email address and the initial password assigned by your Administrator, log in to the application.
5.  If prompted, please make sure that you change your password. You may be prompted during your first login to change the password.
6.  Once logged in, you'll see the application dashboard as the landing page.
7.  Congratulations! You're ready to use the system.
